## Project Initiation
### Title
e-Nurture

### Background of the Problem
The childcare industry faces challenges like limited caregiver access, unreliable services, and poor communication tools, leaving parents struggling to ensure safe, professional care (Reinventing Childcare, 2023; Beebe, 2024). Caregivers seek reliable clients and better resources, while providers must meet rising demands with high standards (Modestino et al., 2021). This paper proposes an " eNurture platform service" to address these issues through digital tools that relieve pain and create gains for parents, caregivers, and providers to be aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). Therefore, the objective of this paper is to develop a conceptual eNature business model for the "Childcare E-Platform" that integrates digital platforms and apps to provide child caretaker services acting as pain relievers and gain creators including: 

    Providing parents with secured, reviewed, user-friendly tools for finding and vetting child caregivers, enhancing their trust and confidence. 

    Offering customizable childcare service packages and flexible booking options to accommodate various family schedules and needs. 

    Integrating real-time communication, monitoring, and tracking features for transparency and peace of mind. 

    Equipping child caregivers with access to a supportive, dependable network, enabling them to provide consistently high-quality care.
