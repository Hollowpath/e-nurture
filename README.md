## Project Initiation
### Title
e-Nurture

### Background of the Problem
The childcare industry faces challenges like limited caregiver access, unreliable services, and poor communication tools, leaving parents struggling to ensure safe, professional care (Reinventing Childcare, 2023; Beebe, 2024). Caregivers seek reliable clients and better resources, while providers must meet rising demands with high standards (Modestino et al., 2021). This paper proposes an " eNurture platform service" to address these issues through digital tools that relieve pain and create gains for parents, caregivers, and providers to be aligned with SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), SDG 4 (Quality Education), and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth).

### Purpose or Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a conceptual eNature business model for the "Childcare E-Platform" that integrates digital platforms and apps to provide child caretaker services acting as pain relievers and gain creators including:
- Providing parents with secured, reviewed, user-friendly tools for finding and vetting child caregivers, enhancing their trust and confidence. 
- Offering customizable childcare service packages and flexible booking options to accommodate various family schedules and needs. 
- Integrating real-time communication, monitoring, and tracking features for transparency and peace of mind. 
- Equipping child caregivers with access to a supportive, dependable network, enabling them to provide consistently high-quality care.

### Target User
- Parent in need of childcare service
- Childcare giver
- B40 interested in working as a childcare giver
- Donor

### Preferred Platform
Platform: Android Mobile App (Only)

### Features and Functionalities
The following features and functionalities leverage key mobile device capabilities, enhancing user experience and app performance:

1. **Geolocation Services for Booking and Matching Caregivers**  
   The app integrates **GPS** and **geolocation services** to help parents find nearby childcare providers in real time. This feature enhances the booking process by displaying caregivers who are within a user's preferred distance, ensuring convenience and accessibility.

2. **Push Notifications for Real-Time Updates**  
   Push notifications are implemented to provide real-time updates to both parents and caregivers. For example, parents will receive notifications when a caregiver confirms their booking, and caregivers will be alerted about new job offers or training opportunities, keeping them engaged and informed.

3. **In-App Messaging and Communication**  
   The app uses mobile device communication tools (SMS, push notifications, in-app chat) for seamless communication between parents, caregivers, and platform support. This enables instant messaging and secure exchanges of information, making the app highly interactive.

4. **Camera Integration for Profile Photos and Document Uploads**  
   The app allows both parents and caregivers to upload **profile photos**, **certifications**, and **training documents** directly via the mobile device's camera. This ensures that both parties have up-to-date profiles and documents that can be verified, helping to build trust within the platform.

5. **Push-Based Training and Certification Notifications**  
   Caregivers can receive **push notifications** about new training opportunities, certification deadlines, or reminders for skill updates. These notifications will be personalized based on caregivers' profiles, ensuring that they stay on top of necessary qualifications.

6. **User Profile and Sentiment-Based Review System**  
    **Mobile-based sentiment analysis** can help summarize caregiver reviews into an overall sentiment score. Ratings and reviews will be collected and displayed within the app to build trust and ensure transparency between caregivers and parents.
